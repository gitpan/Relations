=head1 NAME

Relations - Functions to Use with Databases and Queries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Relations;

  $as_clause = as_clause({full_name => "concat(f_name,' ',l_name)",
                         {status    => "if(married,'Married','Single')"})

  $query = "select $as_clause from person";

    print "Avoiding the bug...";

  }

  unless ($avoid->{code}) {

    print "Not avoiding the code...";

  }

=head1 ABSTRACT

This perl library contains functions for dealing with databases.
It's mainly used as the foundation for all the other 
Relations modules. It may be useful for people that deal with
databases in Perl as well.

The current version of Relations is available at

  http://www.gaf3.com

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 WHAT IT DOES

Relations has functions for creating SQL clauses (like where, 
from etc.) from hashes, arrays and strings. It also has functions
for converting strings to arrays or hashes, if they're not hashes
or arrays already. It even has an argument parser, which is 
used quite heavily by the other Relations modules.

=head2 CALLING RELATIONS ROUTINES

All standard Relations routines use an ordered argument calling style, 
with the exception of the configure_settings() and get_input() functions 
which use an ordered, named, and hashed, argument calling style. This 
is because most routines have only a few arguments, and the code is 
easier to read with an ordered argument style. With the functions that
have many arguments, the code is easier to understand given a named or 
hashed argument style.

If you use the ordered argument calling style, such as

  $answer = get_input($question,$default);

the order matters, and you should consult the function defintions 
later in this document to determine the order to use.

If you use the named argument calling style, such as

  $answer = get_input(-question => $question,
                      -default  => $default);

the order does not matter, but the names, and minus signs preceeding them, do.
You should consult the function defintions later in this document to determine 
the names to use.

In the named arugment style, each argument name is preceded by a dash.  
Neither case nor order matters in the argument list. -question, -Question, and 
-QUESTION are all acceptable.  In fact, only the first argument needs to begin 
with a dash.  If a dash is present in the first argument, Relations assumes
dashes for the subsequent ones.

If you use the hashed argument calling style, such as

  $answer = get_input({question => $question,
                       default  => $default});

or

  $answer = get_input({-question => $question,
                       -default  => $default});

the order does not matter, but the names, and curly braces do, (minus signs are
optional). You should consult the function defintions later in this document to 
determine the names to use.

In the hashed arugment style, no dashes are needed, but they won't cause problems
if you put them in. Neither case nor order matters in the argument list. 
-question, -Question, and  -QUESTION are all acceptable.  If a hash is the first 
argument, Relations assumes that is the only argument that matters, and ignores 
any other arguments after the {}'s.

=head1 LIST OF RELATIONS FUNCTIONS

An example of each of these functions is provided in 'test.pl'. 

=head2 rearrange

  my (@arg_list) = rearrange($order,@param]);

Rearranges arguments from either the straight ordered format, or 
named format, into their respective variables. 

B<$order> - 
Array ref of argument names in their proper order. Names must
be capitalized.

B<@param> - 
Array of values to parse.

EXAMPLES

B<Using:>

  sub example {

    # Get the defaults sent.

    my ($first,
        $second,
        $third) = rearrange(['FIRST',
                             'SECOND',
                             'THIRD'],@_);
  }

B<Calling Ordered:>

  example('one','two','three');

B<Calling Named:>

  example(-first  => 'one',
          -second => 'two',
          -third  => 'three');

B<Calling Hashed:>

  example({first  => 'one',
           second => 'two',
           third  => 'three'});

  example({-first  => 'one',
           -second => 'two',
           -third  => 'three'});

=head2 delimit_clause

  delimit_clause($minor,$major,$reverse,$clause);

Creates a clause for a query from a hash ref, an array ref, or 
string. If sent a hash ref, the key-value pairs will be concatentated 
with the minor string and those pairs will be concatenated with the major 
string, and that string returned. If an array ref is sent, the members 
of the array with will be concatenated with the major string, and that 
string returned. If a string is sent, that string will be returned. 

B<$minor> - 
String to use to concatenate between the $clause hash ref key and 
value. 

B<$major> - 
String to use as the key-value pair if $clause is a hash ref, or 
array members if $clause is an array ref.

B<$reverse> - 
Value indicating whether to concatenate keys and values if $clause 
is a hash ref in key-value order ($reverse is false), or value-key
order ($reverse is true).

B<$clause> - 
Info to parse into a clause. Can be a hash ref, array ref, or 
string. 

=head2 as_clause

  as_clause($as);

Creates a 'select' or 'from' clause for a query from a hash ref, 
an array ref, or string. If sent a hash ref, the key-value pairs 
will be concatentated with an ' as ' between each value-key pair and 
those pairs will be concatenated with a ',' , and that string 
returned. If an array ref is sent, the members of the array with will 
be concatenated with a ',' and that string returned. If a string is 
sent, that string will be returned. 

B<$as> - 
Info to parse into a clause. Can be a hash ref, array ref, or 
string. 

EXAMPLES

B<Hash:>

as_clause({full_name => "concat(f_name,' ',l_name)",
          {status    => "if(married,'Married','Single')"})

returns: "concat(f_name,' ',l_name) as full_name,if(married,'Married','Single') as status"

=head2 equals_clause

  equals_clause($equals);

Creates a 'where' or 'having' clause for a query from a hash ref, 
array ref, or string. If sent a hash ref, the key-value pairs will 
be concatentated with an '=' between each value-key pair and those 
pairs will be concatenated with a ' and ' , and that string returned. 
If an array ref is sent, the members of the array with will be 
concatenated with a ' and ' and that string returned. If a string is 
sent, that string will be returned.

=head1 TODO LIST

=head2 Think of more things to do. :)

=head1 OTHER RELATED WORK

=head2 Relations (Perl)

Contains functions for dealing with databases. It's mainly used as 
the foundation for the other Relations modules. It may be useful for 
people that deal with databases as well.

=head2 Relations-Query (Perl)

An object oriented form of a SQL select query. Takes hashes.
arrays, or strings for different clauses (select,where,limit)
and creates a string for each clause. Also allows users to add to
existing clauses. Returns a string which can then be sent to a 
database. 

=head2 Relations-Abstract (Perl)

Meant to save development time and code space. It takes the most common 
(in my experience) collection of calls to a MySQL database, and changes 
them to one liner calls to an object.

=head2 Relations-Admin (PHP)

Some generalized objects for creating Web interfaces to relational 
databases. Allows users to insert, select, update, and delete records from 
different tables. It has functionality to use tables as lookup values 
for records in other tables.

=head2 Relations-Family (Perl)

Query engine for relational databases.  It queries members from 
any table in a relational database using members selected from any 
other tables in the relational database. This is especially useful with 
complex databases: databases with many tables and many connections 
between tables.

=head2 Relations-Display (Perl)

Module creating graphs from database queries. It takes in a query through a 
Relations-Query object, along with information pertaining to which field 
values from the query results are to be used in creating the graph title, 
x axis label and titles, legend label (not used on the graph) and titles, 
and y axis data. Returns a graph and/or table built from from the query.

=head2 Relations-Report (Perl)

An Web interface for Relations-Family, Reations-Query, and Relations-Display. 
It creates complex (too complex?) web pages for selecting from the different 
tables in a Relations-Family object. It also has controls for specifying the 
grouping and ordering of data with a Relations-Query object, which is also 
based on selections in the Relations-Family object. That Relations-Query can 
then be passed to a Relations-Display object, and a graph and/or table will 
be displayed.
